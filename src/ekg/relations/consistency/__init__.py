"""Global consistency solvers for the constructed event graph.

The relation extractor predicts edges (largely) independently, so the raw graph
can contain causal loops, temporal contradictions, and unclosed coreference.
A consistency solver repairs these into a globally coherent graph:

- causal & temporal: break directed cycles by dropping the lowest-confidence
  edge in each cycle until the subgraph is acyclic (temporal acyclicity is
  enforced over the strict-order subtypes only — OVERLAP-style edges carry no
  order and pass through);
- temporal: optionally add transitively-implied BEFORE edges (closure over the
  strict-order subtypes);
- coreference: deduplicate and (optionally) close clusters.

`identity` is a no-op used for the "-consistency" ablation. New strategies
(e.g. an ILP solver) register here without touching callers.
