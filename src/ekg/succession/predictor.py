"""Successor-event predictors: rank a candidate set for one anchor event.

Deliberately separate from the legacy entity-centric ``TemporalQuad`` contract.
CGEP ranks *events* out of an explicit candidate set given a graph, and squeezing
it into temporal quads would misstate the successor-prediction task.

`evaluate` reports the optimistic (SeDGPL) and strict rankings side by side. The
gap between them is the share of the score that duplicate triggers hand over for
free, and it is large on real data, so no caller gets to see only one of them.
