"""Rebuild CGEP instances from MAVEN-ERE.

SeDGPL (EMNLP'24 Findings, arXiv:2409.17480) introduced CGEP but shipped only
its ESC build (`ESCSubWoRe.npy`); the MAVEN build its `load_data.py` reads
(`data/MAVENSubWoRe.npy`) was never released. Its published CGEP-MAVEN numbers
are therefore *not* same-data comparable, and the corpus has to be rebuilt from
MAVEN-ERE under an explicitly stated protocol.

Protocol (each choice is checked against the statistics SeDGPL reports, and
against what its `tools.py` template builder actually requires):

* **ECG** = one weakly-connected component of a document's causal
  (``CAUSE`` + ``PRECONDITION``) *and* ``subevent`` edges, with at least
  ``min_nodes`` events. Temporal ``BEFORE`` edges are excluded from the
  topology: adding them takes the component density to ~235 edges/ECG, which no
  20-edge linearisation budget can carry. They re-enter downstream as structural
  features, not as graph structure.
* **Coreference** is already collapsed by MAVEN-ERE (one ``events[i]`` is one
  cluster); the first mention represents the cluster, matching SeDGPL's
  `processNode` ("选择第一个共指事件").
* **Query edge** = an edge whose tail has out-degree 0 *and* in-degree 1. This
  is forced by the prompt format rather than chosen: SeDGPL renders every
  template edge as a pair of event tokens, so a gold successor appearing in any
  other edge would print its own answer token into the prompt. Occurring solely
  in the query edge is exactly ``outdeg == 0 and indeg == 1``.
* **Candidate set** = ``n_candidates`` distinct event nodes drawn uniformly from
  the split, always including the gold successor and *not* excluding the source
  ECG's own nodes. This is read off the one build SeDGPL did release
  (``ESCSubWoRe.npy``): its candidate sets hold 256 distinct event identities,
  gold is always present, draws are near-uniform corpus-wide, and roughly 17% of
  a graph's own nodes reappear as candidates -- exactly what uniform sampling
  without exclusion produces. Its precise eligibility rule is not recoverable
  (161 of its candidates never occur in any released ECG), so uniform sampling
  over the split is ours and must be cited as such.

  Candidates are *nodes*, not trigger strings, so two candidates may share a
  trigger. That is faithful: SeDGPL keys its added vocabulary by mention string
  and scores candidates by token id, so colliding triggers score identically. In
  the released ESC build only ~178.0 of the 256 candidates are distinct answers.

Measured against the paper (train+valid, ``min_nodes=4``): 2994 documents
(paper 3015), 8.82 nodes/ECG (8.4), 13.21 edges/ECG (12.9), 10116 instances
(12200). The ECG count (3743 vs 5308) does **not** reconcile and is reported as
a known deviation rather than tuned away.

The query-edge rule above is not a guess: on all 1192 instances of the released
ESC build, the gold successor has out-degree 0, in-degree 1, and never occurs in
a template edge.

Note on edge order: SeDGPL's `getTemplate` truncates by *stored order* before
sorting the survivors by graph distance, so the order edges are emitted in here
is load-bearing for any faithful baseline. It follows document order.
