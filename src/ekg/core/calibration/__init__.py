"""Conformal calibration: distribution-free risk control for the EKG system.

The verifier's third duty. Beyond gating (inference) and rewarding (training),
the same evidence/rank nonconformity drives a *risk controller* with finite-
sample guarantees:

- stateless kernels (`functional`): the split-conformal quantile / prediction
  set used everywhere a single exchangeable threshold suffices;
- streaming calibrators (registry `conformal_calibrators`): ``split`` (static,
  exchangeability-only baseline), ``aci`` (adaptive, drift-robust),
  ``weighted`` (recency-weighted, non-exchangeable), ``crc`` (Conformal Risk
  Control, bounds a monotone loss such as the coverage-set miss rate);
- diagnostics (`metrics`): rolling coverage / drift gap over time, plus the
  selective-prediction kernels re-exported from `core.eval.faithfulness`.

Importing the package registers all calibrators, so config-driven selection
(`build_calibrator("aci", alpha=0.1)`) works without importing submodules.
